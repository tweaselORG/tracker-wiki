# Detect tracking data transmissions in HAR files using TrackHAR 

[TrackHAR](https://github.com/tweaselORG/TrackHAR) is our library to extract transmitted data from tracking requests in mobile apps. Here, you can use TrackHAR online without having to download anything. The processing happens entirely locally in your browserâ€”your files are never uploaded to our server.
