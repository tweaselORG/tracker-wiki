# Detect tracking data transmissions in HAR files using TrackHAR 

[TrackHAR](https://github.com/tweaselORG/TrackHAR) is our library to extract transmitted data from tracking requests in mobile apps. Here, you can use TrackHAR online without having to download anything. The processing happens entirely locally in your browserâ€”your files are never uploaded to our server.

<noscript>JavaScript is not enabled. Because the processing happens only in your browser, you need to enable JavaScript to use the tool. Your data will remain on your device the whole time.</noscript>
